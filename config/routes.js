 * Routes

/**
 * (2) Static routes
 *
 * This object routes static URLs to handler functions--
 * In most cases, these functions are actions inside of your controllers.
 * For convenience, you can also connect routes directly to views or external URLs.

  // This is where you want to set up root-relative dynamic routes like:
  // http://yourwebsite.com/twinkletoez
  //
  // NOTE:
  // You'll still want to allow requests through to the static assets,
